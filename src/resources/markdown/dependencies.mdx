It started out as a fork from [packd](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/packd) and over the time evolved and
we removed the support for umd fallback. Since, we want it strictly to be _esm_ based beacause of requirements

## How different it is from UNPKG and PIKA and JSPM

- UNPKG can be considered as cdn from npm. It basically parses the route you are asking for and serves the code.
  It doesn't do any _bundling_, _transpiling_ or _compressing_.

- PIKA and JSPM does transpiles the code from `cjs` to `esm` and then _remaps_ all the imports for the dependencies that are used.
  All these are compiled ahead of time and served to the user.

- Both `pika` and `jspm` are doing a great job in handling all the problems that are arising due to the
  mis-configured packages.

## Then why we need a new one ?

- We need a purely `esm` based one, so we can't rely on `unpkg`. Yes, it does have `format=esm` flag.

- These `cdn's` mostly rely on exports-map which is a standard in node. But, most of the libraries which
  are shipped to npm today don't actully specify the `exports-map`. They use sometihg called `module` field
  from `package.json`. So, these cdn's need to do some static-analysis to get these convered.

- The `module` field is used by bundlers but not a standard in `node`. So, there is some sense of confusion
  on all these fields.

- In the course of time, we had ran into several issues. Here, i am trying to explain a few of them.

## Missing Dependencies !

When a package author forgets in defining a package in the `package.json`. This becomes a very tricky problem even to find out.
Here is why, which loading a package we might mainly look at the `package.json` which shows us the direct dependencies of the package you are using.
But, we will not a picture of all the `sub-dependencies` of the dependencies that the main package is using.

Here is a example, `antd@4.6.1` is using `rc-image` and `rc-image` in return is using `rc-util`. But rc-util did not mention
that it is using a package called `react` in it's code. But defined as `devDependency` but not as a `peerDependency`.

When you are using such kind of a package to bundle or build, we usually use the command that we had below.

> npm install --production

To install only dependencies and not devDependencies or peerDependencies. So, we manualy install peerDependencies. Even then the package `react`
won't be installed since it is missing from both `depepdencies` and `peerDependencies`. If we serve such package from a `cdn` service, they tend to fail.
Since the package is missing from both the places. So, `cdn's` fail to reolve them.

## Package exporting cjs under main !

The most commong approach that many package authors take is, exporting `cjs` using `main` field in package.json. And `esm` using `module` field.
This is a pattern that is encouraged and followed mainly on the bundlers userland. But in node environment you need to export using only `main` field. Since, `module` is not supported.
Instead we have a another field called, `type : module` to defined if the code we are exporting is a es mdoule or a cjs bundle.

To overcome this issue, `cdn`'s like `jspm` does a ahead of time static analysis. This makes then understand the package structure and the files and exports.
But during this step, they mainly rely on `exports` field which is a `node` standard. And which is again not used by most of the pacakge authors, since bundlers are not using them at the moment.

In such instances, the static analysis fails and `cdn's` faile to serve the packages when request a specific module.

## Change in sub-dependencies !!

If you are using a sub-package called `b`. Let's consider `a` which is your main package uses `10.0.0` and then
`b` initally was at `5.0.6` and you built your project around it and things are fine. But then `b` had a new
release of `5.0.7` which have a breaking change. Currently the cdn's are not pinning down this so, in future you
might pull `5.0.7` and the package will stop working.

JSPM is solving this issue in their future release of `jspm-cli` which exports a `import-map` of every dependency that is used.
For more details please visit the discussion in here -->https://github.com/jspm/project/issues/76

## Loading multiple versions of the same library

It's difficult to pin down the version of react library that you are using.
For example you are using `react` and your `dependencies` are also using react of various versions. Then it will be
loaded multiple time since you are serving unbundled and so imports w.r.t to your packages `deps` or `peerDeeps`
are loaded.

Loading multiple versions of react sometimes breaks your project. Here is a jsfiddle [example](https://jsfiddle.net/vbf7mst9/1/)
If you can run the example and inspect the console, you can see react is loaded with `16.0.8` and `16.13.1`

So, currently they load the latest version by default. Here is a `unpkg` [link](https://unpkg.com/browse/@material-ui/core@4.11.0/package.json)
of `@material-ui/core@4.11.0`. You can see the `peerDeependency` of react is `16.8.0`. But when loaded from cdn,
it loads `16.13.1`. Cdn link --> https://cdn.skypack.dev/-/antd@v4.6.1-chaSqPebG9J1riQcD3Q8/dist=es2020/antd.js

This behaviour is the best the `cdn's` are doing for us inorder to save the projects from breaking.

> Then why we don't run into issues like this with our projects when build locally ?

Yes, it's completly logically to think in that way. Then we need to look at how the bundlers work.

## Traditional Bundlers

The main source of truth for bundlers is `node_modules`. So, in most of the cases they don't care about where
the dependency is mentioned (deps, peerDeps, devDeps). They just check the package and load it from `node_modules`
at the time of bundling. Here is a example https://github.com/saleehk/lowdb-google-cloud-storage-adapter/issues/1

If you check the PR, i was mentioning to move `babel-polyfill` from `devDependency` to `peerDependency`.
Because, if we look at the code https://github.com/saleehk/lowdb-google-cloud-storage-adapter/blob/master/src/index.js#L3
The package is being used, but when checked in `pacakge.json` it is present under https://github.com/saleehk/lowdb-google-cloud-storage-adapter/blob/master/package.json#L17

So, if any `x` package from your project uses `babel-polyfill` then during `npm install` this is resolved.
And the bundlers don't throw any error, since all they care if the package is in `node_modules`.But when you
using it in a isolated way, this does breaks your build, since `babel-polyfill` is not resolved during installation.

By default only `peerDependencies` and `dependecies` are only resolved.

## The Future !!

I persoanlly like approach that `deno` has taken. Betting on `esmodules` is the future i am looking forward.

- Loading code from any source and not relying on `node_modules` or some specific CDN service to do the heavy lifting.
- Or waiting for a package author to provide a format that we want to load.
- Loading only a specific module from a specific pacakge using `export` maps, gives us
  tree-shaking approach out of the box. Yes, the bundlers which we use gives us the `tree-shaking` support but it has it's limitations.

And i am excited about the `jspm version 3` release.

If anyone is looking for a package, which follows all these standards and can serve as a good learning point. Please check --> https://unpkg.com/browse/preact@10.4.8/package.json

## Conclusion

To have a quick solution for solving the above issues, the best way is have a mash up. Transpile the pacakges to `esm`
at the sametime bundle then with `dependencies`. So, we are not dynamically relying on anything.

I would highly recomend to watch the talk by [@guybedford](https://twitter.com/guybedford) in youtube https://youtu.be/keKKODs6Z7M?t=950,
where he explains about the future vision of package managers and upcoming releases for jspm.
