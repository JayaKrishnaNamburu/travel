In this blogpost, let us discsuss about the state of current _CDN_ based unbundled application development looks like.
I recently started working with esm based cdn's and there are some short comings because of how the modules are being published to npm.
Most of the modules are being published using _cjs_ format and a _esm_ entry with _module_ flag in package.json file which is again a non nodejs standard.

So, i recently started working on something, where to mix both _esm_ and _bundling_. Like a hybrid version of cdn which servers packages from npm but bundled.
It started out as a fork from [packd](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/packd) and over the time evolved and
we removed the support for umd fallback. I will try to point out a few obseervation and try to explain then,
a full unbundled development is just a few steps away.

## How traditional UNPKG is different from Skypack and JSPM

- UNPKG can be considered as "mirror" for npm packages. It basically parses the route you are asking for and serves the code.
  It doesn't apply any _bundling_, _transpiling_ or _compressing_. But unpkg has a new flag `?module` which looks for the module entry point instead.

- PIKA and JSPM does transpiles the code from `cjs` to `esm` and then _remaps_ all the imports to a statically transpiled ahead of time packages.

- Both `pika` and `jspm` are doing a great job in handling all the problems that are caused because of mis-configured packages.

## Then why we need a new one ?

As i was referring earlier that i was working on a version on my own. Let's see the "why" and "what" and "how" here.

- We need a pure `esm` based one, so we can't rely on `unpkg`. Yes, it does have `?module` flag. But it doesn't remap your imports.

- These `cdn's` mostly rely on exports-map which is a standard in node. But, most of the libraries which
  are shipped to npm today don't actully specify the `exports-map`. They use `module` field
  in `package.json`. So, these cdn's need to do some static-analysis of the package to serve them for clients.

In the course of time, we had ran into several issues. Here, i am trying to explain a few of them.

## Missing Dependencies !

When a package author misses defining a package in the `package.json`.
When using a package we mainly look at direct dependencies from `package.json` that the package is using.
But, we need to be careful about the `sub-dependencies` of the `direct-dependencies` the main package is using.

Here is a example, `antd@4.6.1` is using `rc-image` and `rc-image` in return is using `rc-util`. And `rc-util` uses `react`
directly in it's [files](https://unpkg.com/browse/rc-util@5.4.0/es/ContainerRender.js) . But the package [defines](https://unpkg.com/browse/rc-util@5.4.0/package.json) `react` and `reat-dom`
as `devDependency` but not as `peerDependency`.

According to npm [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file), it's clear that devDependencies are using only in local development and testing.
Any package that is required by your application should go under dependecies or peerDependencies.

When we are using such packages to bundle or build, we usually use the command that we had below.

> npm install

which unstalls both deependencies and devDependencies but when we use

> npm install --production

It install's only dependencies and not devDependencies. So, even if we manualy install peerDependencies. `react`
is not installed as it is missing from both `depepdencies` and `peerDependencies`. If we serve such package from a `cdn` service, they tend to fail.
Since the package is missing from both the places. So, `cdn's` fail to reolve to fetch any `meta` like package version etc. And few cdn's resolve to the latest version of the package in that case.

## Package exporting cjs under main !

The most common approach that package authors take is, exporting `cjs` using `main` field in package.json. And `esm` using `module` field.
This is a pattern that is encouraged and followed mainly on the bundlers userland.

But in node environment you need to export using only `main` field. Since, `module` attribute is not supported or a standard in node.
Instead we have a another field called, `type : module` which is a node [standard](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_enabling) to define if the code we are exporting is a es mdoule or cjs.

And for `esm` modules we the file extension is `.mjs` and not `.js`. But the bundlers userland will accept even if we use the `.js` extension for modules.

To overcome this issue, `cdn`'s like `jspm` does a ahead of time static analysis. This makes then understand the package structure and the files and exports.
But during this step, they mainly rely on `exports` field which is a `node` standard. And which is again not used by most of the pacakge authors, since bundlers are not using them at the moment.

In such instances, the static analysis fails and `cdn's` faile to serve the packages when request a specific module.

## Change in sub-dependencies !!

If you are using a sub-package called `b` and `a` as your main package and `a` is at version number `10.0.0`.
`b` is initally at `5.0.6` and you built your project around it and things are fine. But then `b` had a new
release of `5.0.7` which have a breaking change.

"This happens when semver is not properly followed. Because breaking changes shouldn't go under patch or minor released"

[Semver](https://semver.org/#what-if-i-inadvertently-alter-the-public-api-in-a-way-that-is-not-compliant-with-the-version-number-change-ie-the-code-incorrectly-introduces-a-major-breaking-change-in-a-patch-release)

Currently the cdn's are not pinning down this so, in future you might pull `5.0.7` and the package will stop working.

JSPM is solving this issue in their future release of `jspm-cli` version 3, which exports a `import-map` of every dependency that is used.

## Loading multiple versions of the same library

It's difficult to pin down the version of library that you are using withou scopes in importmaps.
For example if you are using `react` and your `dependencies` are also using react of various versions. Then react is
loaded multiple times since you are serving unbundled and imports resolve w.r.t to your packages `deps` or `peerDeeps`
are loaded.

Loading multiple versions of react sometimes breaks your project. Here is a jsfiddle [example](https://jsfiddle.net/vbf7mst9/1/)
If you can run the example and inspect the console, you can see react is loaded with `16.0.8` and `16.13.1`

So, currently `cdn's` load the latest version by default. Here is a `unpkg` [link](https://unpkg.com/browse/@material-ui/core@4.11.0/package.json)
of `@material-ui/core@4.11.0`. You can see the `peerDeependency` of react is `16.8.0`. But when loaded from cdn,
it loads `16.13.1`. Cdn link --> https://cdn.skypack.dev/-/antd@v4.6.1-chaSqPebG9J1riQcD3Q8/dist=es2020/antd.js

And, from the jsfiddle [example](https://jsfiddle.net/vbf7mst9/1/) we can understand that, there is a unspoken `vendor effect`.
Right now, we have `jspm` and `skypack` and each have their own approaches in solving these issues. So, when you project is loading from multiple vendors, make sure you are
not running into problems like these. Or they have the potential to break the application.

> Then why we don't run into issues like this with our projects when build locally ?

Yes, it's completly logically to think in that way. Then we need to look at how the bundlers work in more details below.

## Traditional Bundlers

The main source of truth for bundlers is `node_modules`. So, in most of the cases they don't care about where
the dependency is mentioned (deps, peerDeps, devDeps). As we run

> npm install

which installs both `dependencies` and `decDependencies`

They just check the package and load it from `node_modules` at the time of bundling.
Here is a issues https://github.com/saleehk/lowdb-google-cloud-storage-adapter/issues/1 which expains it more clearly.

If you check the PR, i was mentioning to move `babel-polyfill` from `devDependency` to `peerDependency` or `dependency`.
Because, if we look at the [code](https://github.com/saleehk/lowdb-google-cloud-storage-adapter/blob/master/src/index.js#L3)
The package is being used, but when checked in `pacakge.json` it is present under devDependencies https://github.com/saleehk/lowdb-google-cloud-storage-adapter/blob/master/package.json#L17

So, if any `x` package from your project uses `babel-polyfill` then during `npm install` this is resolved.
And the bundlers don't throw any error, since all they care if `babel-polyfill` is in `node_modules`.But when you
using it in project where no other package loads `babel-polyfill`, this does breaks your build. As, `babel-polyfill` is not resolved during installation.

## The Future !!

I persoanlly like approach that `deno` has taken. Betting on `esmodules` is the future i am looking forward.

- Loading code from any source and not relying on `node_modules` or some CDN service to do the heavy lifting of transpilation for us.
- Or waiting for a package author to provide a format that we want to load.
- Loading only a specific module from a specific pacakge using `export` maps, gives us
  tree-shaking out of the box. Yes, the bundlers which we use gives us the `tree-shaking` support but it has it's limitations.

And i am excited about the `jspm version 3` release.

If anyone is looking for a package, which follows all these standards and can serve as a good learning point. Please check [preact](https://unpkg.com/browse/preact@10.4.8/package.json)

## Conclusion

To have a quick solution for solving the above issues, the best way is have a hybrid version of cdn.

- Transpile the pacakges to `esm`
- Bundle it with `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`. So, we are not dynamically relying on anything or any change in sub-packages etc.

I would highly recomend to watch the talk by [@guybedford](https://twitter.com/guybedford) in [youtube](https://youtu.be/keKKODs6Z7M?t=950),
where he explains about the future vision of package managers and upcoming releases for jspm.
