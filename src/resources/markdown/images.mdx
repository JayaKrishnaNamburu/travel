One of my main requirements for me when building this blog, is to have a place to share all the images that i click in my travels.

But at the same time, I am too picky with the size of the application that i ship to the end users. The last one anyone want to experience is
to visit my gallery and loose some **10-15MB** of their data. May be the **10-15MB** doesn't sound soo big, but the more images i keep adding the more size.

And on top of that, the browser painter engine, should process all the image data and then paint them maintaining at _60FPS_ to the end users. So, instead i
built my own pipeline, for handling images on my own.

_"Don't re-invent the wheel"_, this is one of those _"things"_ we keep listening in programming. But i often try to go in the loop, just to learn how things works
under the hood. And understand the concepts better.

### Complications we face with images on the web

- Image Sizes
- Layout Thrashing
- Compression type
- Effective loading of images

### What is layout thrashing ?

When we load a website, like visiting www.google.com from our browsers. There are a series of steps that takes places
from making a request to the servers to respoding back. But let's look at how this received information is rendering
by the browsers, so we can see and interact with it.

- First browsers, [parse]('https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#HTML_Parser') your `index.html` file and builds a **DOM** tree which is available at `window.document`.
- Next they parse our css stylesheets and generates [CSSOM]('https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model') which helps in constructing the CSS tree.
- Then Painter comes into the picture and starte [rendering]('https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#Painting') using the trees.

Every interaction we make on the application, like clicking a modal, hiding or closing a division. Causes a side effect, which means
there is some change in the DOM tree. Which triggers the painter to kick in and render the screen again.

This cycle happens for every once in [insert the time taken for one frame] to give a good user experience at 60FPS. But if the DOM
elements keep changing their positions that is when the main-thread takes up the heat. And that's why DOM operations are expensive.

### Image Sizes

We want hero images to showcase our products, when potential clients land on our home pages.
At the same time we want images and assets to be rendered without loosing quality. But we already know
that compressing something means, it looses a bit of information to reduce the size.
But it's not exactly true in all the cases.

First, let's see how the size of media effects our applications.

- Takes time to parse the media information and render it to the view.
- Takes more time to load from the server when the users are in slow networks.
- The slower the images load, the more the issues with layout thrashing.

Lossing data from the images and loosing quality depends on two reasons.

- Type of compression.
- Format of media.
