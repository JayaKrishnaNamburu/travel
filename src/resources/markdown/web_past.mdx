Have we ever asked these questions to ourself :thining_face:

- Why did we start building websites ?
- How does the web pages in the past do even look ?
- How's the web on the present day looks like ?

Yes, these questions seem a bit strange right to someone. But when we look at the rate at which web-dev is increasing, there are many new dev's are coming on board. When started in 2016, i jumped on the hype train and started building with popular frameworks and libraries. But it took a long time for me to realise that we are heading into the very first thing which we swore to fulfil.

#### Why did we start building websites ?

To share data and information in an effective way, so every person over the internet can access it and get benefited from that.

#### How does the web in the past looks like ?

Just a bunch of **html + css + js** (the sequence is very important). Even today browsers follow the same sequence when loading webpages.

#### How's the web on the present day looks like ?

- A `index.html` file as a entry. (It still exists because we did not find a way to replace it with JS yet !!)
- For `css` we started using `css-in-js` which in return adds `js` to your bundles (yes, not in all the cases).
- And finally our favouriate step, `js` and `js` and more `js`.

**Toolchain**

The toolchain has changed a lot, i sometimes feel we are making them as complex as possible everyday. In initial days i used to spend most of my time in deciding

> If i should learn the library and framework or should i start learning the setup and tool chain process.

Let's explore how a present day toolchain looks like..

- Library of choice
- Bundler
- Transpiler
- Compiler (not all the time, but if you are using typescript with babel we end up having one for transpiling and one of compiling)
- Plugins for our **Transpiler**
- Plugins for our **Bundler**
- If you are using JSX, we need a seperate plugin to support that
- CSS-In-JS library and friends.
- Typescript / Flow for type-checking.
- Polyfills
- Code Formatters
- Linters
- Ok! State Managment and friends
- Everyone uses a service worker

We, definitely not going to ship into our _production_ bundles with all the things that mentioned above. But everything has it's significant impact.

Our applications are becoming complex than ever and so our toolchains also should. In the following series of posts i will share all the things that i learning. I will try to cover by findings on the following topics.

- Initial Bundle size and impact.
- Static and SSR.
- Handling images.
- Progressive Enhancement.
- Font's and Typography.
- Choosing Dependencies.
