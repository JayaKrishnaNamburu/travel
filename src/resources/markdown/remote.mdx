At the time of writing this blog, i am completing my first 6 months at <Link href="https://twitter.com/teleportHQio">@teleportHQio</Link>, and honestly this is the best place and team that i have ever got a chance to work with.
One of the most important things that i enjoy working is, we are trying to **"bend the technology for humans"**.

We have a suit of **oss** projects in our GitHub and a playground which works in sync with them. We are creating technologies, that not only allows us to achive this but by
open sourcing the core elemnets of the tech, we are paving ways for the future teams exploring the path.

### Introduction !!

I was always a motivated individual, but used to fiddle around how to channel the motivation in the right away. A huge thanks to my friend <Link href="https://twitter.com/imAnushree">@iamAnushree</Link>,
she introducted me to "tech twitter". Initially i wasn't aware of how powerful the "tech twitter" is, if you use it right. Fast-forward into the future i didn't pay much attention to oss until hacktober fest 2018. I started digging into open source more and
made my first PR to <Link href="">@mattermost</Link>. 

> Yes, i want the "hacktober fest tee-shirt" !!

And again, i abandoned oss for a while. After being busy in office and stuff for a while. phew !!

### Realising the potential

I enjoy reverse engineering more than the actual development phase. Yes, initially it was always a concerning for me. "How we can dive into a code that is somone written". But over the time, we will get a hang of it.
Then i started contributing to some projects here and there, and everytime i am PR gets merged. I am **all above the sky** :)

### Coming across teleportHQio

A couple of years back i had no idea about what's teleportHQio is and, what the tech that is powering all the wizardy to happen behind. I am traveeling overnight and just checking twitter. And came acrsso this tweet.

<Link href="https://twitter.com/teleportHQio/status/1103654046097960962">Tweet Link</Link>

I quickly visited their <Link href="https://github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators">GitHub</Link> repo. And realised that the whole source is open, but one thing constantly bugged me that night is how is this even possible. How machines write such clear code like humans.

I forked their repo and started chekcing everything in my free time. The best way to get a hand of a repo is to pick a **good first issue** and try fixing it.
They are looking for a changelog and versioning setup, and as a person with interest in infrastrucutre. I quickly started to look at options and started to suggest a few and did a initial implementation. My <Link href="https://github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators/pull/77"> first PR </Link>

I was a small one, but my current collegues <Link href="https://twitter.com/alexnmoldovan">@alexnmoldovan</Link>, <Link href="https://twitter.com/agilius">@agilius</Link> and <Link href="https://twitter.com/Utwoo">@Utwoo</Link>  who are repo mainainers at the time (yeah, i am dead scared to ask anything at that time :D). Helped me in figuring out.


### Keeping up with the consistency

This time, i didn't want to happen as my previous instances. I just keept looking at issues and fixing them and continuing my consistency in contributing to various other projects at the same time.
(I sometimes feel a little happy for myself, i was able to reach *95* PR's today to the same repo). 

Over the time, we got to know well and i reached the team via twitter and we exchanged some video calls too :D. Next we wanted to migrat the current setup to a monorepo based multiple packages setup. To expand the eco-system and bring in plugin system to the generators.
And this has been the time, when i burrined my mind inside it and was able to rewamp the architecture to a lerna based <Link href="https://github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators/pull/177">monorepo</Link>.

### Onboarding :)

I received a text from <Link href="https://twitter.com/alexnmoldovan">@alexnmoldovan</Link> saying that i am being officially invited to come onboard for the team :D. I couldn't sleep that night with all the excitement.

After a series of discussions, we decided the dates and the process of onboarding. In March 2020, i joined the team.

### Working remotely

I was working full time in office, and entering into a remote life took a couple of days for me. But at the same time, we started to face
lockdowns everywhere. This made the adaption a little more complicated, but the team was very supportive. I almost never actually felt the transition, 
it went so smooth. I sometimes feel did i really swith to a new company :)

We have, **Tech tuesdays**, **Coffe breaks** and some **games** where we try to understand each other and get some time from work.
We keep our discussion off the work during these times strictly, since we want to continue the virtual human interaction apart from work.
I never felt like i am missing working in a office environment.

### Key take aways so far 

- #### Do i miss the office commute ?

  My answer for this is, "i don't know" ;). May be i started working remotely and at the same time everyone started to "work from home". So, i did not find the difference
  between "working remotely" and my other friends "working from home".

- #### What would you suggest for someone who wants to start working remotely ?

  Yes, don't swing around in making the descision for the switch. It's definitely worth the path to explore. But there are few things that i will suggest which i learned
  over the time of working and adjusting myself to the new workflow.

  - Have a dedicated *work station* for yourself. You don't need a fancy work station. But a dedicated space for wokring, mainly a table a chair for yourself helps a lot.
  
  - If you can have a seperate *dedicated room* will takes the experience up a notch. I personally suggest this, since if we are not mixing 
    up the room where we work and where we eat and have some entertainment stuff. It helps in zoning out from all the thoughts
    and get's you into the mood for work.
  
  - Try to have a *proper work schedule*, often we will be different time zones. So, this plays a very important role. You either underwork or overwork, depending on the type of the day.
    But this needs to be properly monitored, since in a proper office environment we have fixed time slots for lunch, coffee or going back home.
    This is one of the most important thing that <Link href="https://twitter.com/alexnmoldovan">@alexnmoldovan</Link> always emphasis on and make sure that i am keping in practice.
  
  - Last, but the most important one. *Communication* is the key when the team is distributed. Always, try to be clear on what's in your mind and what you are conveing to the team.
    Don't hesitate to ask or to raise a discussion when something is not clear.

  - Plan your meetings properly and do a little *homework* on what to discuss and what you want to ask before joining a call. In a traditional office environment,
    for simple things and adhoc discussions, we can just ask the person before us on anyone on the floor. And sometimes may be when you eat or have some coffee together.
  
  - But when you are remote, you need to have a *scheduled meeting* when you want to have some discussions. Since, we need to consider the persons *timezone*, *availability* and *meetings scheduled* and not to
    interrupt their *workflow*.

- #### Why we need to consider contributing to oss

  This is one of the most asked question for me, when i suggest someone to work in oss. The answers are simple for me.
  
  - You get to work in multiple projects with multiple backgrounds and architectures. It helps a lot when you are need to quickly dive into a project in middle.
  
  - You get to work with some of the best people who are always willing to help, and evaluate the code and suggestions for improvement.

  - Helps in understanding the whole eco-systems and the development trends a lot better. This personally helped me in quickly evaluating my implementations with the existing solutions and iterate on them at a much faster pace.

  - And finally, contributing to oss is not only a code contributions. You can do, financial contributions too. This is particularly very important and less spoken outside. We often take the hard work from the authors as granted.
    I personally started to financially contribute to a couple of projects slowly at a pace where i can manage.


### Conclusion

So far, the past *6 months* was a amazing experience for me. I have personally learned a lot, helped in improving the tech we had and still in the process of exploring. If you have any futher doubts, hit me up at <Link href="https://twitter.com/askjkrishna">@askjkrishna</Link>.
