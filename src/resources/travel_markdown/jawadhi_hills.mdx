- Are you are road trip lover ?
- Are you biker ?

Road trips are always fun and give's us a way to escape the reality and the busy life. I often find reasons to travel :D

And our road trip to **Jawadhu Hills** is one such example.
I heard about it from my friends and always wanted to do a short road trip for a weekend. But we know a little about the place, infact all we know about the place is just the name.
So, we agreed on a date and quickly set ourself on the task of preparing our bikes for the trip.

### Our Machines and Preparations !!

<em>
  (Yes, you call them machines :D because "It's made like a gun and goes like a
  bullet !!")
</em>

Since, it's going to be regular small road trip. We just had a regular service and checkup's and some saddle bag's to pack all the clothes and stuff.

I drive a [Royal Enfield 350 ]() and my friend used [Royal Enfield 350x](). We agreed upon on starting at **5:00am**, but the actual start time was something different ;)

### Route and Location

There is one route which takes you to Jawadhu Hills from Chennai in 4hrs. But, we decided to take a little longer one via **Thiruvananthapuram - Kanchipuram** highway since it goes via forests and hills.
Bike trips and road trips are mainly not about the destination and more about the journey. And belive me the route we took extended our riding time but ter route is worth it.

### Crusing time !!

We started from Chennai after re-fuelling our *"machines"* and 2 hrs into the journey. 
One of our bikes decided it should grab some attention from us, and fortunately we were able to reach a nearest service Center.

### Reaching the Destination 

After a **6hrs** ride, we reached our destination. 
The main town is located in between the hills and immediately reaching the destination, we decided to listen to our food cravings.
So, next step is to find a place to stay and go around the place right ?

Nah, we realised there are no hotel's to stay :( Yes, there are no private hotels or goverment tourism hotels to stay for a night !!
</p>

### A quick Detour !!

So, with no place to stay for the night anywhere nearer. We decided to set on one more short journey for **2hrs** to reach [Yelagiri](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yelagiri,+Tamil+Nadu+635853/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3badaaba63efaa8f:0x565d6a5d54337a3c?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8mbDx3rPpAhVUfH0KHXeIBtcQ8gEwJ3oECBYQBA).
Yelagiri is the closest Hill station with some decent facilities to stay.

### Reaching Yelagiri

I have been to Yealgiri previously on another bike ride. But the entrance road that leads to the hill, is my favourite. 
You can slowly pick up the pace and cover the **14 Hairpin bends** to reach a small town with few resturants and Hotels to stay.
But we decided to stay in a tent, because ** Why not ??**

**Things to do in Yealgiri**

Yelagiri is a quite and small place when compared to other hill stations. But you can get to do

- A small "trek" to Swami Malai Hills.
- Have some fun with sports.
- Camp fires.
- Paddle boating.
- Stroll around in the Government Park and attend a water show.

The hill top of Swami Malai are breathtaking, You almost feel like you are on top of the clouds. 
You could go for the trek at around **6am**, we planed to go a little early. But the locals insisted as they came across bears somethimes in the early Morning :D .
Try to plan for the trek only in the moring as the time goes on, the sun will not show any mercy here !!
