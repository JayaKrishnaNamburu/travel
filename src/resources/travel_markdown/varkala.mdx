- Are you a beach lover ?

- Ever wished that you'd get to spend your entire day near the waves ?

- Watch the sunset, and then retreat to your cozy little room only to wake up to the view of the beach again?

If so, then Varkala is the place for you. It's a small town situated in Tiruvanthapuram to the south of Kerala.
The main attraaction of the place is the ** Varkala Cliff ** which is popularly know as the only cliff beach in India.

I came to know about this place and immediately decided to visit after watching the pictures. After several attempts finally able to make it on February of 2020, with two other friends.

<PostSubHeader>How did we reach here ?</PostSubHeader>

<div className="splitPost">
<p>

We took a train from Chennai to Varkala Sivagiri, which is the nearest railway station.

If you feel like having a morning walk, i highly recomend to do so. It's a _15mins_ walk from the railway station to the cliff.
Auto rickshaws are available right outside the railway station.

If your hotel is along the Varkala cliff like we had, you'd have to get down near **Helipad** and walk the remaining distance along the cliff, asking local shopkeepers the way, till you find the hotel.

<PostSubHeader>Where did we stay ?</PostSubHeader>

We found a small but cozy and budget friendly place called the [Dolphin Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x3b05ef1ad006e1db%3A0x2daa04519d199e58!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOzkBM5NysmOOM3nNXWlutluilQii5v3U5lZxp1%3Dw240-h320-k-no!5sdolphin%20bay%20varkala%20-%20Google%20Search!15sCAQ&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipOzkBM5NysmOOM3nNXWlutluilQii5v3U5lZxp1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAo_S33LDpAhVFzDgGHe2nDWwQoiowDHoECBQQBg).
The place is right next to the Varkala Cliff, which is surounded by many hotels.

<PostSubHeader> What makes Varkala Cliff such a happening place?</PostSubHeader>

It's a narrow road along a long cliff, with the beach down below on one side of the road, shops and restaurants lined up on the other side.
Among the closely packed shops, most of them sell souvenirs, wooden artifacts, handicrafts, beach clothes and herbal products.

And if you are a person looking for some culture mix, this would be definitely a weekend gateway.
We came across people who came all the way here to have some peaceful time and some for learning yoga. Pleople practicing yoga along the beach at early in the morning is such a common sight here.

<PostSubHeader> What about the food ? </PostSubHeader>

<div className="splitPost">

<p>
The cliff is filled with cafe's and resturants and we could find mostly continental food, probably owing to the large number of foreign tourists who stay long term in the area.

Who doesn't want to come for view's like this, when you are having a hot coffe or a lunch.

Most cafe's and resturants flaunt the variety of fresh fish available near their entrances. You could select the fish and then get it cooked the way you like.

Even if you are not a fish lover, the variety of foods is amazing. On a side note, the meals are not completely budget friendly.
If you're looking for an authentic Kerala meal, we'd recommend going away from the cliff into the interior parts of the town.

<PostSubHeader> What else apart from the cliff ? </PostSubHeader>

Well, the cliff has much more to offer you other than only a beach side stay experience. Here are few things we did and i strgonly suggest anyone to do.

<div className="splitPost">
<p>

**Sunsets**

Sunset's are very beautiful to watch. The option thing will be grabbing a quick coll drink and find a nice spot under the tree's near the beach to watch the sunset.

<Suggestion>
  PS: Try to reach the spot by _5:30pm_ may be, in summer it get's very hot and
  it becomes very difficult to find a spot with some shade.
</Suggestion>

**Star Gazing**

If you are person who likes gazing at stars like me, then this is one of the nocest places where you could do that.

</p>

</div>

My picture might not be doing the proper justice, but belive me since the place is way from the city light pollution.
You will get to see them very clearly, but the light's along the cliff add a little bit of noise too.

<p>

<PostSubHeader>Live Music and Open Mic Nights</PostSubHeader>

Live Music and open mic nights are very commong here. You can get to see flyers around the cliff, announcing the time, location and the activity.
You can quickly grab a drink, have some food and sink in the live music when the cool natural air from the sea blows.

**Shopping**

You could find many souviner shops along the cliff. You could get some gifts back home or do some quick shopping for dresses.

</p>

</div>

**Water sports and backwaters**

A few minutes ride in auto from the cliff, you could reach **[Kappil beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kappil+Beach,+Kerala/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3b05ef871cecadd3:0xb0887b7d70708538?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vZyf7LHpAhVPwjgGHdlCCkYQ8gEwHnoECBMQBA)**.
It's a very interesting place, on once side of the road that runs along the cost you could see the **Arabian Sea** and on the other side you will get to see the **back waters**.

And you could spend some time on the back waters and have fun with water sports.

<PostSubHeader> Is it all beaches? </PostSubHeader>

Nope, not all. Although not exactly a part of Varkala, the [Jatayu Earth Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jatayu+Earth's+Center/@8.8605987,76.8669812,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x77a24d56f5a90c70?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtmI7k7LHpAhXsxzgGHYAdBQYQ_BIwI3oECBQQCA) is a must visit. It offers a different experience altogether compared to the relaxing atmosphere of the beaches.

We took a 28km cab ride from the cliff to reach the place.

The place looks super clean and it is situated on top of a mountain.
You could reach the top either by walk and **cable card** or, you could have a **helicpoter** ride. We took the cable card ride, and it's rewarding the experince.

<!-- **Cable cars**
