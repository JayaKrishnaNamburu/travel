Are you a beach lover? Ever wished that you'd get to spend your entire day near the waves? And watch the sunset, then retreat to your cozy little room only to wake up to the view of the beach again? If so, then Varkala is the place for you.

When I got to know about this place and saw the pictures, I immediately decided to make a visit. After several attempts, I was finally able to make it on the February of 2020, with two other friends.

<PostSubHeader>How did we reach here?</PostSubHeader>

<div className="splitPost">
  <div>

We took a train from Chennai to Varkala Sivagiri, which is the nearest railway station.

Auto rickshaws are available right outside the railway station. If your hotel is along the Varkala cliff like we had, you'd have to get down near the [Helipad](https://goo.gl/maps/zWdxw3VBNDYE7uct6) and walk the remaining distance along the cliff, asking local shopkeepers the way, till you find the hotel.

However, if you happen to reach the station in morning and love morning walks like I do, I highly recommend you to skip the auto rickshaw ride and take the _15 minute walk_ from the railway station to the cliff.

<PostSubHeader>Where did we stay?</PostSubHeader>

<div>

  We found a small but cozy and budget friendly place called the [Dolphin Bay](https://goo.gl/maps/vEhMtqYKucvPy9NE9).
It is right next to the Varkala Cliff, which is the most vibrant place in the town.

<PostSubHeader> What makes Varkala Cliff such a happening place?</PostSubHeader>

It's a narrow road along a long cliff, with the beach down below on one side of the road, shops and restaurants lined up on the other side. 
Walking is the only way to move about this narrow road. Among the closely packed shops along this road, most of them sell souvenirs, wooden artifacts, handicrafts, beach clothes and herbal products. 
You can find numerous restaurants studded in between, most of them open to the beach side.

The path is lively with people from all over the world. Live music, yoga sessions or just sitting on the beach side enjoying the calm, this place has something for all. 
It is very common to see yogis along the beach in the early morning hours.

<PostSubHeader>How can one spend their time here?</PostSubHeader>

**Sunsets**

Grab a quick cool drink, find a cozy spot in the beach to watch the sun go down. A must for a relaxing holiday.

<Suggestion>
  PS: Try to reach the spot by about 5:30 pm, in summer it gets very hot and it becomes very difficult to find a spot with shade.
</Suggestion>

**Shopping**

Do you love collecting souvenirs or want to take something back for your folks at home?
Did you forget to pack enough beach clothes? Don't worry, the shops by the cliff have got you covered.

**Live Music and Open Mic Nights**

You can find flyers announcing these events everywhere. If you find the beach view from the restaurant not captivating enough, you could easily find a place that offers live music to enjoy your supper. The cool evening breeze from the sea make the vibes perfect.

**Star gazing**

For someone who loves star gazing, coming to a place like this far away from the light pollution
of the city is an absolute treat. We were able to observe the stars pretty clear, although the
lights along the cliff did add a little noise. This picture here hardly does justice to the what
we saw there.

**Yoga sessions**

If you're planning to extend your stay, you could sign up for the yoga classes available at the cliff. 
This is something we couldn't explore though.

<PostSubHeader> What about the food? </PostSubHeader>

<div className="splitPost">

<p>
Along the cliff we could find mostly continental food, probably owing to the large number of foreign tourists who stay long term in the area.

Most restaurants flaunt the variety of fresh fish available near their entrances. You could select the fish and then get it cooked the way you like.

Even if you are not a fish lover, the variety of foods is amazing. The best part is, you get to enjoy a view like this while having your meal. Now who wouldn't love that!

On a side note, the meals are not completely budget friendly. Also, if you're looking for an authentic Kerala meal, we'd recommend going away from the cliff into the interior parts of the town.

<PostSubHeader> What else apart from the cliff? </PostSubHeader>

**Water sports and backwaters**

A few minutes auto rickshaw ride from the cliff, you could reach **[Kappil beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kappil+Beach,+Kerala/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3b05ef871cecadd3:0xb0887b7d70708538?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vZyf7LHpAhVPwjgGHdlCCkYQ8gEwHnoECBMQBA)**.
This place is special: On one side of the road that runs along the coast, you could see the **Arabian Sea**. On the other side, a glimpse of the magnificant **back waters** of Kerala. There are a variety of water sports available here, like kayaking and boating.

**Is it all beaches ?**

Nope, not all. Although not exactly a part of Varkala, the [Jatayu Earth Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jatayu+Earth's+Center/@8.8605987,76.8669812,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x77a24d56f5a90c70?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtmI7k7LHpAhXsxzgGHYAdBQYQ_BIwI3oECBQQCA) is a must visit. It offers a different experience altogether compared to the relaxing atmosphere of the beaches.

We took a _28km_ cab ride from the cliff to reach the place. This tourist attraction is situated on the top of a hill. To reach the top, you could either climb the steps, take a **cable car** ride or even a **helicopter** ride. We took the cable card ride, and it was a rewarding experience.
The place is well maintained and super clean. Prefer a cloudy day to come here though, otherwise the heat might spoil the experience.
