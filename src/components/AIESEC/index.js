              I joined AIESEC In Vijaywada during my college days. and ever since I became a part of
              it, The topics in which we work had a significant impact in the way I started seeing
              the world around me.

            <span>I was lucky enough to get into “</span>
            <span className={styles.text07}>Incoming Exchanges</span>
            <span>
              ” where we get an opportunity to host people from around the world. We work with some
              of the local NGO’s who are trying to solve some problems, like education for the kids,
              Sustaining orphanages, reducing pollution and carbon foot print etc.

              we get the opportunity to work with someone who have already gained some knowledge on
              these issues in their countries and help us in applying the same towards the local
              community. In this process, we exchange each others traditions culture and exposure to
              how people from different background look at different things in life.

              I started to work as a team member in Incoming Exchanges, and helped in leading few
              projects and successful in leaving an impact. I enjoy seeing a successor, for me it’s
              gives a sense of satisfaction that I was able to inspire someone and take my position
              and carrying the torch forward. And at the time of leading “Magnetos”.

              I lead few projects called “E = mc2” with the motto of bringing aware about nature and
              the sense of saving it to the kids. I enjoy working wit kids, most of my projects in
              the time of AIESEC are close to them.

              Because, it’s comparitavely easy to mould them at young age and at the same time,
              their minds are always curious to learn and we were able to expose them to the right
              things. It leaves a moment of inspiration which keeps them towards those goals.
